# first food for baby

### About The App

When we have baby for the first time, first thing we have to study is something like this.

* I don't know how to cook!
* I don't know how much they eat!
* I don't know if it's safe for them!
* Does baby have allergy of this food?

What we need is to be calm down and search information, but unexpectedly it's really hard searching those things with
taking care of baby.

Fortunately, there's already exist a bunch of services for helping those situations.
But I realized there's few services for people who living foreign country for the first time and don't know the
complicated info from service, so I made easy one by myself.

This is the app for foreigner live in Japan and struggle baby food situation every day for the baby!

Here's information we need.

* What food can baby eat
* How to cook
* Recording foods they tried, allergy symptoms and like/dislike
* Save their photos(for good memory)
* Japanese food tips

I don't have such skill to create a perfect app, but try my best!
